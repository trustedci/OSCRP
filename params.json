{"name":"OSCTP","tagline":"Open Science Cyberthreat Profile","body":"# Open Science Cyberthreat Profile (OSCTP)\r\nWelcome to OSCTP, a project of the [Center for Trustworthy Scientific Cyberinfrastructure](http://trustedci.org), the [NSF](http://nsf.gov) Cybersecurity Center of Excellence.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the coming year, the OSCTP working group will develop a “threat profile for open science” and co-author a document describing that threat profile. The threat profile will be be a categorization of scientific assets and their common risks to science to greatly expedite risk management for open science projects and improve their cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nThe working group threat profile is scoped to science projects that are “open,” that is unclassified. E.g. funded by [NSF](http://nsf.gov), [DOE ASCR](http://science.energy.gov/ascr), [NIH](http://www.nih.gov).  (They may be under limited-time scientific embargo, however, and may include PHI, such as with NIH research).\r\n\r\nWe will take an asset/impact-oriented approach.  Explicitly, we are not concerned about threat actors or specific attack methods, but what assets open science projects have, what harms could befall those assets, and what the impacts from those harms would be to the project.\r\n\r\n*“An asset/impact-oriented approach starts with the identification of impacts or consequences of concern and critical assets, possibly using the results of a mission or business impact analyses and identifying threat events that could lead to and/or threat sources that could seek those impacts or consequences.”*\r\n\r\nFor assets that are commodity IT or for which a risk profile already exists, this effort should reference that profile and not duplicate it, except where the “open science” aspect is in conflict with the existing risk profile.\r\n\r\n## What is an asset?\r\n“Assets” are computing systems, data storage systems, networking, digital sensors, scientific and other advanced instruments, scientific data, personnel, and an interoperable suite of software services and tools, including data repositories, visualization environments, and analytic environments. Assets also include the computer-controlled, network-connected elements of physical plants responsible for the safety and security of these systems, such as power and HVAC.\r\n\r\n## Working Group\r\n* Ilkay Atlintas, SDSC\r\n* RuthAnne Bevier, Caltech\r\n* James Cuff, Harvard\r\n* Tim Minick, Gemini Observatory\r\n* Rich LeDuc, Northwestern\r\n* Bertram Ludäscher, UIUC \r\n* Pascal Meunier, HUBzero\r\n* Reagan Moore, iRods\r\n* Steve Schwab, ISI \r\n* Karen Stocks, UCSD\r\n\r\n## Organizers\r\n* Sean Peisert\r\n* Von Welch\r\n* Michael Dopheide\r\n* Susan Sons","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
